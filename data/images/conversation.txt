James: "Hey there, we're new to this town. My name's James, and this is Dane."

Malcolm: "Nice to meet you both. I'm Malcolm. So, what brings you to Boomtown?"

Dane: "We've been traveling through the desert for months, and we were hoping to find some sign of human life. We stumbled across this place and thought we'd check it out."

Malcolm: "Well, you're in luck. There's plenty of life here, and plenty of gold too. I came here to prospect, and I've found more than I ever could have imagined."

James: "Gold, huh? That's interesting. We don't have much use for it, but it's always good to know where we can find it."

Malcolm: "Oh, you'll find a use for it. Everyone does eventually. So, what do you guys do?"

Dane: "Well, I used to be trapped in a cryotherapy chamber for eight years, so I don't have much experience with anything. James here lived in an abandoned airport for four years."

Malcolm: "Wow, that's quite the story. You guys must have some serious survival skills. Maybe you can help me out with something. I've been having trouble with some bandits that keep trying to steal my gold. I could use some extra protection."

James: "We'd be happy to help. We've been through worse, I'm sure."

Dane: "Yeah, and we could use a place to stay for a while. We've been on the move for so long, it would be nice to settle down for a bit."

Malcolm: "Sounds like a deal to me. Welcome to Boomtown, boys."
